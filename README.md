# ðŸ“Š Summary of Analysis

This project was conducted using a synthetic dataset with 100 entries built for financial demographic profiling. Key attributes include:

- Demographics: Age, Sex, Region, Marital Status, Children  
- Financial indicators: Income, Car ownership, Saving account, Current account, Mortgage, PEP investment  

Using Wekaâ€™s built-in visualization capabilities, each attribute was analyzed and plotted to uncover relationships, data quality, and segmentation patterns.

# ðŸ“Œ Some key insights:
- Age distribution leans toward middle-aged individuals with occasional spikes in senior profiles.
- Gender distribution shows a balanced sample with slight female dominance.
- Region data helps uncover urban vs rural financial behavior segmentation.
- Income histogram & boxplots indicate economic diversity with visible outliers.
- Financial product ownership varies significantly across demographics, visible via pie charts.

All outputs were saved inside the /outputs/ folder and sequenced exactly as they appear in the PDF, starting with the combined overview and followed by individual attribute plots.
